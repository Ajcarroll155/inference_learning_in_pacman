# inference_learning_in_pacman
Implementation of inference learning algorithms using UC-Berkeley's Pac-Man project template

This was a project for CS-3600 (Intro to Artificial Intelligence) at Georgia Tech. Using the template provided, I utilized a Bayesian Network, an implemented algorithms for belief distribution, particle filtering, and other aspects of inference learning. Files containing personal code include:
    1) bustersAgents.py
    2) inference.py
All personal code is marked at the start and end points with comments, and can also be found in the project description file "Project 3.htm"
